# config/scripts

A collection of useful shell and SQL scripts that can be executed **manually** (interactively) to:

- Configure TDE or Unified Auditing
- Encrypt/decrypt tablespaces
- Load sample schemas and test data
- Perform backup, clone, or duplication scenarios

These scripts are not executed automatically by the container.
