# ğŸ“˜ TDE Use Case Documentation

This folder contains hands-on technical documentation for various Oracle TDE (Transparent Data Encryption) configurations supported in this project. Each use case is structured for DBAs and engineers to test, validate, or implement TDE scenarios both with software-based keystores and Hardware Security Modules (HSM).
