# Oracle Directory Server Enterprise Edition on Docker
Docker base image used for miscellaneous Oracle Directory Server Enterprise Edition engineering .
Docker build files to facilitate installation, configuration, and environment setup for Docker DevOps users. For more information about Oracle Directory Server Enterprise Edition please see the [Oracle Directory Server Enterprise Edition 11.1.1.7.2 Online Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E29127_01/index.htm).

Just to clarify these Docker build scripts are **unofficial** Oracle Build scripts. See [Oracle Docker images](https://github.com/oracle/docker-images) on GitHub for the official Oracle Docker build scripts.

## Content

* ~~[OUD Base](https://github.com/oehrlis/oudbase) environment developed by [ORAdba](www.oradba.ch)~~
* Oracle OFA Directories see below
* Oracle Directory Server Enterprise Edition 11.1.1.7.171017

### Environment Variable and Directories
Based on the idea of OFA (Oracle Flexible Architecture) we try to separate the data from the binaries. This means that the OUD instance as well as configuration files are explicitly stored in a separate directory. Ideally, a volume is assigned to this directory when a container is created. This ensures data persistence over the lifetime of a container. OUD Base supports the setup and operation of the environment based on OFA. See also [OraDBA](http://www.oradba.ch/category/oudbase/).

The following environment variables have been used for the installation. In particular it is possible to modify the variables ORACLE_ROOT, ORACLE_DATA and ORACLE_BASE via *build-arg* during image build to have a different directory structure. All other parameters are only relevant for the creation of the container. They may be modify via ```docker run``` environment variables.

In general it does not make sense to change all possible variables. Although *BASEDN* and *ADMIN_PASSWORD* are good candidates for customization. all other variables can generally easily be ignored.

### Scripts to Build and Setup
The following scripts are used either during Docker image build or while setting up and starting the container.

| Script                         | Purpose
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
| ```check_odsee_instance.sh```  | Check the status of the ODSEE instance for Docker HEALTHCHECK
| ```config_odsee_instance.sh``` | Configure ODSEE instance using custom scripts
| ```create_odsee_instance.sh``` | Script to create the ODSEE instance
| ```start_odsee_instance.sh```  | Script to start the ODSEE instance
| ```setup_oudbase.sh```         | Script to install OUD base

## Installation and build
The Docker images have to be build manually based on [oehrlis/docker](https://github.com/oehrlis/docker) from GitHub. The required software has to be downloaded prior image build and must be part of the build context or made available in a local HTTP server. See [Build with local HTTP server](#build-with-local-http-server) below. When providing a local HTTP server to download the required software during image build will lead into smaller images, since the software will not be part of an intermediate intermediate container. The procedure was briefly described in the blog post [Smaller Oracle Docker images](http://www.oradba.ch/2018/03/smaller-oracle-docker-images/).

### Obtaining Product Distributions
The Oracle Software required to setup an Oracle Unified Directory Docker image is basically not public available. It is subject to Oracle's license terms. For this reason a valid license is required (eg. [OTN Developer License Terms](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/licenses/standard-license-152015.html)). In addition, Oracle's license terms and conditions must be accepted before downloading.

The following software is required for the Oracle Unified Directory Docker image:
* Oracle Directory Server Enterprise Edition 11.1.1.7.0. Alternatively you may use the latest patch release via MOS Patch ID [26724938](https://updates.oracle.com/ARULink/PatchDetails/process_form?patch_num=26724938)

The software can either be downloaded from [My Oracle Support (MOS)](https://support.oracle.com), [Oracle Technology Network (OTN)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/index.html) or [Oracle Software Delivery Cloud (OSDC)](http://edelivery.oracle.com). The following links refer to the MOS software download to simplify the build process.

The corresponding links and checksum can be found in `*.download` files. Alternatively the Oracle Support Download Links:
* Oracle Directory Server Enterprise Edition 11.1.1.7.0 [Patch 26724938](https://updates.oracle.com/ARULink/PatchDetails/process_form?patch_num=26724938) or [direct](https://updates.oracle.com/Orion/Services/download/p26724938_111170_Linux-x86-64.zip?aru=21522204&patch_file=p26724938_111170_Linux-x86-64.zip)

### Build using COPY
Simplest method to build the ODSEE image is to manually download the required software and put it into the build folder respectively context. However this will lead to bigger Docker images, since the software is copied during build, which temporary blow up the container file-system.

Copy all files to the `OracleODSEE/11.1.1.7.0` folder.

```
cp p26724938_111170_Linux-x86-64.zip OracleODSEE/11.1.1.7.0
```
Build the docker image using `docker build`.

```
cd OracleODSEE/11.1.1.7.0
docker build -t oracle/odsee:11.1.1.7.0 .
```

### Build with local HTTP server
Alternatively the software can also be downloaded from a local HTTP server during build. For this a Docker image for an HTTP server is required eg. official Apache HTTP server Docker image based on alpine. See also [Smaller Oracle Docker images](http://www.oradba.ch/2018/03/smaller-oracle-docker-images/).

Start a local HTTP server. httpd:alpine will be pulled from Docker Hub:

```
docker run -dit --hostname orarepo --name orarepo \
    -p 8080:80 \
    -v /Data/vm/docker/volumes/orarepo:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/ \
    httpd:alpine
```

Make sure, that the software is know copied to the volume folder and not part of the local build context any more:

```
cd OracleODSEE/11.1.1.7.0
cp p26724938_111170_Linux-x86-64.zip /Data/vm/docker/volumes/orarepo
rm p26724938_111170_Linux-x86-64.zip
```

Get the IP address of the local HTTP server:

```
orarepo_ip=$(docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' orarepo)
```

Build the docker image using `docker build` and provide the HTTP server.

```
docker build --add-host=orarepo:${orarepo_ip} -t oracle/odsee:11.1.1.7.0 .
```

The _RUN_ command in the Dockerfile will check if the software is part of the build context. If not, it will use the host _orarepo_ to download the software. This way the OUD Docker image will be about 400MB smaller.

## Running the Docker Images
### Setup an Oracle Directory Server Enterprise Edition Container
Creating a ODSEE container is straight forward with **docker run** command. The script `start_odsee_instance.sh` will make sure, that a new ODSEE instance is created, when the container is started the first time.  The instance is created using predefined values. (see below). If an ODSEE instance already exists, the script simply starts it.

The creation of the ODSEE instance can be influenced by the following environment variables. You only have to set them with option -e when executing "docker run":

* **ADMIN_PASSWORD** ODSEE admin password (default *autogenerated*)
* **ADMIN_USER**  ODSEE admin user name (default *cn=Directory Manager*)
* **BASEDN** Directory base DN (default *dc=example,dc=com*)
* **LDAPS_PORT** SSL LDAP port (default *1636*)
* **LDAP_PORT** Regular LDAP port (default *1389*)
* **ODSEE_INSTANCE** ODSEE instance name (default *dsDocker*)
* **ODSEE_INSTANCE_HOME** ODSEE home path (default */u01/instances/oud_docker*)
* **ODSEE_INSTANCE_INIT** default folder for ODSEE instance init scripts. These scripts are used to modify and adjust the new ODSEE instance.

Run your Oracle Directory Server Enterprise Edition Docker image use the **docker run** command as follows:

```
docker run --name odsee <container name> \
--hostname <container hostname> -P \
-e ODSEE_INSTANCE=<your odsee instance name> \
--volume [<host mount point>:]/u01 \
--volume [<host mount point>:]/u01/scripts \
oracle/odsee:11.1.1.7.0

Parameters:
--name:            The name of the container (default: auto generated)
-p:                The port mapping of the host port to the container port.
                   for ports are exposed: 1389 (LDAP), 1636 (LDAPS), 4444 (Admin Port), 8989 (Replication Port)
-P:                Map all exposed ports
-e ODSEE_INSTANCE: The Oracle Database SYS, SYSTEM and PDB_ADMIN password (default: auto generated)
-e <Variables>     Other environment variable according "Environment Variable and Directories"
-v /u01
                   The data volume to use for the OUD instance.
                   Has to be writable by the Unix "oracle" (uid: 1000) user inside the container!
                   If omitted the OUD instance will not be persisted over container recreation.
-v /u01/app/oracle/scripts | /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d
                   Optional: A volume with custom scripts to be run after OUD instance setup.
                   For further details see the "Running scripts after setup" section below.
```

There are four ports that are exposed in this image:
* 1389 which is the regular LDAP port to connect to the ODSEE instance.
* 1636 which is the SSL LDAP port to connect to the ODSEE instance.

On the first startup of the container a random password will be generated for the ODSEE instance if not provided. You can find this password in the output line:
If you need to find the passwords at a later time, grep for "password" in the Docker logs generated during the startup of the container. To look at the Docker Container logs run:

```
docker logs --details oud|grep -i password
```

Alternatively you can check the OUD Base environment for the instance ($ODSEE_INSTANCE) and look for the password file. It is located under _$PWD_FILE_ respectively _${OUD_INSTANCE_ADMIN}/etc/${OUD_INSTANCE}_pwd.txt_.

```
cat $PWD_FILE

cat ${OUD_INSTANCE_ADMIN}/etc/${OUD_INSTANCE}_pwd.txt
```

#### Running Bash in a Docker container
Access your ODSEE container via bash.

```
docker exec -u oracle -it oud bash --login
```

#### Running scripts after setup
The ODSEE Docker image can be configured to run scripts after setup. Currently `sh` and `ldif` extensions are supported. For post-setup scripts just create a folder `scripts/setup` in generic volume `/u01`, mount a dedicated volume `/u01/scripts/setup` or extend the image to include scripts in this directory. The location is also represented under the symbolic link `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`. This is done to provide synergy with other Docker images. The user is free to decide whether he wants to put his setup scripts under `/u01/scripts/setup` or `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`.

After the ODSEE instance is setup the scripts in those folders will be executed against the instance in the container. LDIF files (`ldif`) will be loaded using `ldapmodify` as *cn=Directory Manager* (ADMIN_USER). Shell scripts will be executed as the current user (oracle). To ensure proper order it is recommended to prefix your scripts with a number. For example `01_instance.sh`, `02_schema_extention.ldif`, etc.
