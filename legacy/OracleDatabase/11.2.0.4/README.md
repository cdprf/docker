## Building Oracle Database Docker Image

The *Dockerfile* is setup to use multistage build. The software can either be local in the *software* folder or downloaded during build from a local HTTP server. Both methods will create a space optimized Docker image.

Building the Docker images with local software packages:

```bash
docker build -t oracle/database:11.2.0.4 .
```

Building the Docker images with software packages from a local HTTP server. Where *orarepo_ip* is the name / IP address of the HTTP server:

```bash
export orarepo_ip=192.168.1.5
docker build --add-host=orarepo:${orarepo_ip} -t  oracle/database:11.2.0.4 .
```

## Running Oracle Database in a Docker container

Run your Oracle Database Docker image use the **docker run** command as follows:

```bash
docker run --name oud <container name> \
--hostname <container hostname> -p 1521:1521 
-e ORACLE_SID=TDB112S \
-e INSTANCE_INIT=/u01/config \
--volume [<host mount point>:]/u01 \
--volume [<host mount point>:]/u01/config \
oracle/database:11.2.0.4
```

Alternatively you can use the provided Docker compose file.

```bash
docker-compose up -d tdb112s
```
